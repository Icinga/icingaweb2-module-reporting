Icinga Reporting is the central component for reporting related functionality in the monitoring web frontend and
framework Icinga Web 2. The engine allows you to create reports over a specified time period for ad-hoc and scheduled
generation of reports. Other modules use the provided functionality in order to provide concrete reports.

## Host/Service SLA Reports

With Icinga DB Web there is no additional module required.

If you are still using the monitoring module, please also install the
[idoreports](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-idoreports) module.
